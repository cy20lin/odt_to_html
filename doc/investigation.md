# Investigation

## v1 first version (by claude opus 4.5 thinking)


- Basic conversion work

### Issues

- Fonts differ from the those in original document
- Page split is not visible
- Image caption missing
- footnote not handle properly, show only the part at referencer with footnote number but not referenced footnote
- Drawing Object is not shown

Let me know if there is any difficulty in fixing these issues, 
e.g. recommended using exiting packages or library could help, or other limitation.
